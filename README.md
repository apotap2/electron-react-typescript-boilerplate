# electron-react-typescript-boilerplate

All credits should go to the [original code](https://github.com/iRath96/electron-react-typescript-boilerplate). This fork only shows usage of [my action_switcher library](https://github.com/apotap2/action_switcher). If you will navigate to the app folder you will not see reducers and actions folders, but the switchers one. You can compare with the original version and see the difference in usage.

For more info (how to install, run, license and so on) go to original code.
